## MARS Data
Data for Morris Screening and Gaussian Processes used within project MARS. This data was used to develop Gaussian Process models for predicting a realistic load collective for the rail/wheel system of stacker cranes.

### Repository structure
There are two folders, one for the Morris screening and one for the Gaussian Process models afterwards. The design of experiments are scaled so each prarameter ranges from 0 to 1. The folders also contain the actual intervals for all parameters.
